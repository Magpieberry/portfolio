            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Music can be deeply emotional, but it can also be tied to trauma. The goal was to create a device that allows people to **experience music through touch**, creating a new way to engage with sound while reducing emotional distress.</p>

    <!-- Research & Initial Development -->
    <section class="section image-right">
        <div class="text">
            <h2>Research & Technical Exploration</h2>
            <p>We began by investigating how to **convert audio into tactile sensations**. The challenge was making vibrations feel natural and **not random noise**.</p>
            <p>Early decisions focused on **component selection**, ensuring the device was **comfortable and lightweight**, and experimenting with **different vibration patterns.**</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h2>Prototyping & Refinement</h2>
            <p>Multiple iterations helped us refine the shape for **secure grip and comfort**. The device needed to be quiet, so internal rattling and acoustic interference were key concerns.</p>
            <p>We tested different materials and actuator placements to balance **comfort, weight, and effectiveness**.</p>
